In Her Element Rose Radiant Cleanser (50 ml)


 
WHAT IT DOES:More than just your average facial wash, the Low pH Rose Gel Cleanser (100ml) is a mild purifying cleanser that contains active botanical ingredients to help you achieve clearer, brighter skin. It also features a low pH level (a friendly 5.5-6), which maintains your skin’s moisture barrier – keeping acne-causing bacteria away as well as overly dry or oily skin. 

HOW TO USE: Pump out a centavo-sized amount and build a lather first with your hands. You want to create a rich foam, then massage all over your face. Rinse with water.
