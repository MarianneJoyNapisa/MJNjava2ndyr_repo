SEBAMED Clear Face Care Gel (50 ml)
 


WHAT IT DOES: Sebamed Claer Face Care Gel is the moisturizing gel against pimples, blackheads and blemishes with a pH value of 5.5. When skin is dehydrated or irritated through intensive cleansing or acne therapy, the care gel eliminates a feeling of tightness, roughness and flaking through hyaluronic acid and allantoin, without stimulating the formation of new pimples through oils or emulsifiers. Aloe vera soothes the irritated skin. Panthenol encourages its re-generation. Contains no colorants or perfume substances.

HOW TO USE: Apply on the throughly cleansed skin a small amount of Clear Face Care Gel and distribute evenly on the entire face.
