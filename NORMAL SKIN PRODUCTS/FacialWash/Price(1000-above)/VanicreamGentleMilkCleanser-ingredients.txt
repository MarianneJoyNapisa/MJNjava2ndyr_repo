1. Water
     > The base of the formulation, providing a fluid medium for other ingredients.

2. Glycerin
     > A humectant that attracts and retains moisture, helping to keep the skin hydrated.

3. Coco-Glucoside
     > A surfactant and cleansing agent derived from coconut oil and fruit sugars.

4. Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate
     > A mild surfactant that helps cleanse the skin.

5. Acrylates Copolymer
     > An ingredient that helps stabilize and thicken the formulation.

6. Caprylyl Glycol
     > Acts as a skin-conditioning agent and a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.

7. Mica
     > A mineral that adds a reflective quality, often used for a subtle shimmer or glow in cosmetic products.

8. Sodium Chloride
     > Commonly known as table salt, it may be used here to adjust the thickness of the formulation.

9. 1,2-Hexanediol
     > A solvent and moisture-retaining agent.

10. Titanium Dioxide
     > A mineral sunscreen and pigment that provides white color and UV protection.

11. Sodium Hydroxide
     > Adjusts the pH of the formulation.

12. Disodium EDTA
     > A chelating agent that helps improve the stability of the formulation.



BENEFICIAL INGREDIENTS:

1. Glycerin
     > Hydrates and moisturizes the skin.

2. Coco-Glucoside and Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate
     > Gentle cleansers that contribute to the product's foaming properties.

3. Caprylyl Glycol
     > Acts as a skin-conditioning agent and a preservative.

4. Titanium Dioxide
     > Provides UV protection.



DEBATABLE INGREDIENTS:

1. Mica
     > While generally safe, some people may be sensitive to mica particles.

2. Titanium Dioxide
     > Some concerns have been raised about nanoparticle forms of titanium dioxide, but in larger particle forms, it's widely used in cosmetics.
